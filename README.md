# AU-Calibrated Facial Expression Recognition (AUC-FER)

This repo contains code accompanying the paper, 	[Understanding and Mitigating Annotation Bias in Facial Expression Recognition (Chen and Joo, ICCV 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08504). It includes code for running the few-shot supervised learning domain experiments, including sinusoid regression, Omniglot classification, and MiniImagenet classification.
